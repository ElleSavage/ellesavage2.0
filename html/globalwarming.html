	<h1>My Thoughts on Global Warming</h1>

		<p>This may be a touchy topic, but something I feel very passionate about is protecting our planet. It is sad to me that this topic has turned into a political and economic debate, especially considering the alarming rate that climate change is occurring. </p>


<p>During a friendly debate recently, I brought up how concerned I was that the climate would become unlivable within the lives of the next generation. For me, I think about my young niece and nephew who are too young to have a voice, but who will inherit a planet with extreme heat, erratic and violent storms, dirtier air, and higher levels of insect spread diseases. </p>


<p>In response, this person countered with 'yeah, but the ozone layer is shrinking.' This is something that I didn't know, so I did a little research. Turns out, it's true and very significant. This is a huge win for planet Earth, but it's only thanks to regulations that have pushed for the reduction in chemicals released in the air. </p>


<p>In regards to the Paris Climate Agreement, they were coming from an economic perspective. Why should the US pump out soooo much more money than the rest of the countries who signed the agreement? I understand this frustration, but I also think it is so important for us to set a standard for the rest of the world. As the country with the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, the US has this responsibility. Yes, every country should be contributing, but that doesn't mean we should stop.</p>


<p>The shrinking ozone has given scientists and planet Earth HOPE, but the healing is thanks to 'decades of work by scientists, engineers, and diplomats around the world' (at least according to NatGeo), which means it is important that we maintain our efforts instead of abandon them. </p>


<p>I am very proud to live in a city with a mayor who has promised to continue honoring the Paris Climate Agreement (shoutout to Pittsburgh's mayor for doing the same)!! However, our governor has remained silent on the issue. Again, this is NOT a political position unless you make it one, but the fact remains that our political leaders are responsible for establishing the laws that impact climate change efforts. SOOOOO, here's my point....if you feel strongly about climate change, I suggest you give Governor Wolf a call and urge him to make PA an environmental advocate. You can reach him at 717-696-0058.</p>
