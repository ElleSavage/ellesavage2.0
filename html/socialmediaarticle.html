	<h1>Impact of Social Media on Adolescent's Development and Esteem</h1>

	<main>

<p>Social Media is “’the use of technology combined with social interaction to create or co-create value.” However, scholars are constantly adjusting this definition as the tools, technologies, trends and popular social media sites continue to change at a rapid pace (Pavlik).  However, if you asked a teenager: “what is social media?” their response would likely be to list the several social media sites that they use.  Ten years ago, social media wasn’t even on the map, but today, 71% of teenagers use more than one social network site, the most popular being: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, Google Plus, Vine, and Tumblr, just to name a few (Lenhart). Constantly being drawn to these various social media platforms has proven to have a large impact on how teenagers are developing. In addition to creating sleep issues, the ubiquitous nature of social media today has impacted adolescent’s mental health, self-esteem, and cognitive development. </p>

<p>But, just how often do adolescents use social media? The numbers are quite shocking. 24% of teenagers go online “almost constantly” (Lenhart). In addition to checking their social media accounts upwards to 100 times a day, more than 20% of teenagers also admit to “almost always” waking up during the night to check or post on social media. Needless to say, this interrupts sleep cycles and causes increased fatigue. In addition, more than half of those adolescents who check their phones in the middle of the night say that they usually go to school feeling tired (Gregoire). That is because not only are adolescents sleeping less, but also that their sleep quality is poor (Blaszczake-Boxe). This lack of proper sleep, which is critical during adolescent developmental period, has the potential to harm a teenager’s mental and physical health. For some teens, it is possible that this combination of social media use and disrupted sleep cycles could contribute to mental health issues (Gregoire). </p>

<p>Specifically, adolescents who use social media during the night are more likely to develop anxiety and depression (Udorie). Although a definite relationship between social media use and mental illnesses is yet to be solidified, research shows that teens who spend a significant amount of time, two hours a day or longer, using social media are more likely to report mental health concerns. These reports also indicated a relationship between frequent social media use and suicidal thoughts. This may be due to the fact that these adolescents are feeling constant comparison to their peers, even when they should be sleeping. To make matters worse, the National Citizen Service found that instead of seeking help from parents, teenage girls turn to social media when they are worried (Udorie). This is dangerous because it means that instead of seeking professional help for mental illnesses, teenagers are instead just logging on to social media, only to perpetuate the problems they are facing. Other studies show that there also may be a link between social media use and schizophrenia (Blaszczak-Boxe). The reason behind the social media and mental health connection has not been fully explored, but some studies suggest it may due to an increased exposure to cyber bullying. Another possible causes, as noted before, is that social media encourages individuals to compare themselves to their peers (Villines). </p>

<p>Constant comparison to peers and to social media accounts managed by “perfect girls” and “perfect couples” has created severe impacts on adolescent’s self self-esteem. As discussed in Converging Media by John V. Pavlik and Shawn McIntosh, society has created an image of the “ideal woman” and social media only perpetuates this “ideal” because adolescents cannot escape from this haunting image. One study found that women who use Facebook to compare themselves to other women are more likely to experiences issues with body image (Villines).  Not only do adolescents compare their images, but they compare “likes,” followers, and retweets (Raney). They also compare their lives. Everyone is able to put up their best selves on social media- constantly posting the amazing trips they’re taking, the delicious meals they’re eating, the beautiful friends they have, and it all looks amazing. Even for the strongest willed, it can be difficult to not give in and say, “I wish that was me,” but this exact reaction is what is driving down self-esteem in adolescents. Because teenagers are able to hide behind screens, their reaction to disputes is often very extreme, which only intensifies online feuds, making it easier to hurt others’ feelings. However, this intensity can often be attributed to one’s own low self worth. By taking out these low self esteem issues on their peers, adolescence are perpetuating the cycle of cyber-bullying, social media use, and low self esteem, by lowering others’ self esteem as well (Ehmke).  </p>

<p>A lot of these intense feelings due to poor self-esteem and the false sense of security that social media provides has driven our society to cyber-bullying. Cyber-bullying is as ubiquitous as social media itself: about 43% of teenagers have been bullied online and 70% of students report seeing cyber-bullying occurring frequently (“11 Facts About Cyberbullying”). Cyberbullying may have an even bigger impact on self-esteem than traditional bullying because it cannot be avoided. While teenagers have always been victims of bullying at school, before social media, they were able to go home in peace, but now, bullies are inescapable as they appear on your computer and cell phone’s screen. This issue is more severe than adolescents tend to think it is and because of this, 90% of teenagers who have seen cyberbullying on social media have opted to ignore it. However, victims of cyberbullying are two to nine times more likely to consider committing suicide (“11 Facts about Cyberbullying”). </p>

<p>In terms of cognitive development, social media has had a major impact on adolescents because they are no longer participating in life the way previous generations have. Instead of using free time to talk to others, adolescents are now spending most of their free time behind screens. Not only does this affect communication skills, but it also creates new challenges for teenagers to build and maintain friendships (Ehmke). In turn, this inability to maintain friendships further depreciates self-esteem. In addition to these issues, media has decreased attention spans, which can sometimes develop into attention deficit disorder, a mental health topic that has (not surprisingly) become more and more relevant. Additionally, studies have shown that there is a negative correlation between the time an adolescent is exposed to screens and their academic achievement, meaning: more screen time, lower grades (Kirkorian). Another inhibition that adolescents may develop as a result of excessive social media use is the inability to think independently. According to a study from HP Labs, due to the peer pressure and the publicity of opinions, teenagers are more likely to prefer a certain picture, song, or event politician if it appears to be more popular on social media (Beres). These effects on cognitive development are causing teenagers to suffer from a lack of individuality, communication skills, and attention span, among other vital skills. </p>

<p>Since social media has only become popularized within the last decade, the full effects are only beginning to be understood, but on average, the typical adolescent spends eleven hours a day exposed to digital media, which has proven to impact the cognitive development, mental health and self-esteem of those who engage in it (Shapiro). However, not all the effects of social media can be deemed evil. Despite negative effects on self-esteem and mental health, social media may also act as a place for isolated teenagers to find communities of friends who are able to relate to each other’s situations (Villines). Other studies suggest that social media does have the ability to make us happier, depending on your use of it. Adolescents can use social media to “compare or connect,” and when used for the latter, it can create a sense of psychological satisfaction (Ramasubbu).  In addition, social media may counter negative cognitive side effects because the Internet of Things has allowed teenagers to learn technical skills and advanced mathematics that would not be possible without today’s technology (Ramasubbu). Furthermore, social media does not repress all cognitive functions; in some areas, technology may aid in cognitive development, such as increasing spatial skills (Kirkorian). </p>

<p>It is true that we must take the good with the bad, but are the lasting effects of social media worth the few benefits it provides? The issues covered in this paper are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the effects of social media on adolescents: research from the Colombia University says that heavy social media is related lower self-control when it comes to spending money and study done by Women’s Health says that the bombardment of “food porn” that has been popularized by social media is impacting our appetite, leading to overeating, to name just a couple more side effects of heavy social media use (Beres). Some people are urging for government reform and education programs for adolescents on social media use, while others simply urge parents to limit their children’s’ access to social media, especially during the night. This night time restriction is now being referred to as “the digital sunset” and may be very beneficial in having adolescents take full advantage of the hours of the night where they could benefit more from doing homework or sleeping (Blaszczak-Boxe). Another recommendation for parents is to monitor privacy settings on their teenagers’ social media accounts to prevent possible predators and a loss of privacy (Ramasubbu). However, it is had to determine what is the best move at this time, especially since the holistic effects of social media use are yet to be reported. </p>
