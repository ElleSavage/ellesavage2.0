	<h1>The Beginning of Advertising As We Know It</h1>

		<p>There are two people who I attribute to the advertising world as we know it today: Sigmund Freud and his nephew, Edward Bernays. Freud is most well known for his belief in primitive sexual and aggressive forces hidden in minds that trace back to our animal instincts. The idea of a subconscious is now a well-accepted theory, but during Freud’s time, leaders saw the idea as very threatening. Having feelings were deemed as weak and societies across the globe had yet to accept the possibility of being able to control something as powerful as one’s subconscious. Freud also introduced psychoanalysis as a tool to better understand what people feel and what their primary value and reality assumptions were. Instead of fearing us because of our emotional subconscious like Freud did, advertisers today have learned how to target us using his ideas. </p>
		
		<p>Freud’s ideas about the subconscious were put into practice in the United States by his nephew, Edward Bernays, who was the first to use the knowledge of the subconscious to manipulate the public. He started his career as a press agent under an Opera singer, but further developed his manipulation skills during World War I when he worked as a press agent on behalf of the United States to help sell the war. He was so successful at influencing the masses that he was asked to accompany president Wilson to the Paris peace conference. Following the war, Wilson was seen as a hero and liberator and Bernays recognized that this was very powerful. He had used the public’s value assumptions to determine how to “sell” Wilson and “sell” the war. Often, nations live under similar value assumptions. In this time period, most people held the value assumption that freedom is essential and democracy is the best type of government. Bernays knew how to manipulate these beliefs into the reality assumptions that encouraged people to join the war and that made Wilson a hero. </p>

		<p>This success inspired Bernays to replicate the propaganda used during World War I, but instead of using it for political purposes, Bernays would use it in times of peace for commercial purposes. However, Bernays did not want to continue calling this technique “propaganda” because it had gotten bad reputation due to its use in Germany. Instead he coined the term “public relations.” Public relations has since erupted into the advertising industry that we know today. As we still see in advertisements, Bernays played with irrational emotions rather than focusing on the tangible facts of a product. This is why many of the advertisements we see focus on how we will feel about ourselves when we use a product rather than on the functionality of the product itself. Advertisers use psychoanalysis to understand what out value assumptions are so that they can appeal to these emotions. </p>

		<p>Bernay’s first publically recognized success with public relations came after he was approached by the president of the American Tobacco Association, George Hill, who wanted women to start buying cigarettes despite the social stigma. Bernays recruited one of the leading psychoanalysts in New York City at the time to help run his campaign: A.A. Brill. Brill provided insight to Bernays, offering that cigarettes subconsciously acted as penises and that the only way women could feel comfortable smoking them in public would be if they were doing so as a social statement against men. Using this information, Bernays organized for rich women to light up cigarettes during a parade in New York City and branded the cigarettes as “torches of liberty.” This movement made headlines across the globe because what was in actuality just an advertisement for cigarettes was interpreted to be a symbolic movement. Even though cigarettes don’t actually make women any freer, what’s important is that they make them feel freer, therefore making tangible goods represent intangible feelings and creating an emotional connection between the product and the people. </p>

		<p>There was a movement in advertising following World War I that further focused campaigns on emotions rather than functions. During the war, mass production flourished, but in peacetime, corporations were afraid that their production rates would surpass consumption. This in addition to the arrival of department stores created a push to change the American worker into the American consumer. Before the war, most products were promoted as functional and necessary and at this time, only the rich were used to buying luxury products. This made the transformation into the consumer culture a difficult one, but Bernays succeeded by employing several advertising methods that have carried into our practices today including product placements, fashion shows and celebrity endorsements. He also had celebrities discuss the  “psychology of dress,” which said that how you dress represents how you feel and think. These strategies worked because they targeted people without letting them know they were being targeted. By appealing to the value assumptions of the masses, businesses are able to fabricate a reality assumption that people need their products. </p>

		<p>Freud believed that civilization is not based on the idea of human evolution, but rather it acts as a tool to control natural instincts because humans cannot be free in democracy since their natural instincts are too dangerous. The same rational was used in Nazi Germany: the needs of individuals will not be ignored, but rather they will be addressed in a way that benefits the whole country. Freud was afraid that his ideals would lead to this type of situation, where one group (the Nazis) takes advantage of the masses and allows their followers to release their natural instincts on those outside the group. However, this mentality is why Nazi supporters believed what they’re doing was being done with “forces of love.” Many of the people in the Nazi party were not evil people, but rather just people who had been manipulated into thinking that what they were doing was for the betterment of the world. This is one extreme example about how influential people can create reality assumptions (killing Jews is good) by appealing to value assumptions that the masses hold. This is the same manipulation we are faced with every day in advertisements, but with a less extreme message. Instead of encouraging us to kill Jewish people, advertisements tell us to buy a brand of shoes, but both use this approach to do so. </p>

		<p>After World War I, President Roosevelt took office and created the New Deal, which many businesses disapproved of because they favored laissez-faire capitalism. As a way to combat president Roosevelt’s “attack” on the free market, Bernays and several leaders in the business world created the National Association of the Manufacturers as a way to create an emotional connection between big corporations and their consumers. Their argument was that businesses had built the country into what it is today, not politicians. They used the World’s fair as a platform to preach this message, making the theme of the fair the connection between capitalism and democracy. The businesses that developed and still use these types of emotional appeals believe that the people are not in charge, but that the people’s desires are; that our society is composed mostly of passive consumers driven by irrational unconscious desires. This mentality has carried over into today’s society and accounts for the types of advertisements that we see today. </p>
		
		<p>Very different from the leaders in the early 1900s who were afraid of the unknown desires, leaders today thrive off them. Everyone from politicians to advertisers have accepted that we are driven by our subconscious and they are using it to their advantage. Our value assumptions are interconnected with our subconscious desires, which combined create our reality assumptions. For example, if I have the value assumption that being accepted is good, I probably have the subconscious desire to be accepted. Therefore, when advertisers make a campaign, they create a reality assumption that using their brand will make me be accepted. This type of targeted marketing often bypasses rational thoughts, but works nonetheless because of our subconscious wants. While Freud was alive, he probably would not have guessed how calculated and effective advertisements would become due to his work with psychoanalysis. Since his death, the industry has only grown and become more manipulative thanks to big data that allows advertisers to know everything about us: our friends, our jobs, where we shop, and of course our true desires. </p>
